# KAFKA WRAPPER DOCUMENT

Kafka
-----

Kafka is used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and real-time streaming applications. A data pipeline reliably processes and moves data from one system to another, and a streaming application is an application that consumes streams of data.

Kafka does not support the specific endpoints, so for that purpose we are using kafka wrapper.

Kafka Wrapper
--------------

The Kafka Wrapper provides support for retrieving topic from any Kafka that can return a topic as the endpoint of an URL, and also support for the Kafka which returns Topics in a custom endpoint format.
